  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>1. All menu options except <b>Save</b> will offer to save the current game if the game state has changed since the game was last saved explicitly using the <b>Save</b> option.</p>
  <p>2. Choosing a <b>File</b> menu option while a human player command is executing or during an interactive game replay will automatically complete the execution or stop the replay, respectively.</p>
  <p>3. Hexkit games and scenarios are always stored as XML files. Scenarios are saved as plain XML files and carry an <code>.xml</code> extension. Games receive additional GZip compression and carry an <code>.xml.gz</code> extension, but may also be stored uncompressed with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>
  <p>The most recent autosave files are stored as <code>AutoSave.xml.gz</code> (for human players) and <code>ComputerSave.xml.gz</code> (for computer players) in the current user’s <code>Hexkit\Games</code> folder.</p>
  <p>Please refer to the <em>User’s Guide</em> for more details on Hexkit files.</p>
