  <h1>Hexkit Editor</h1>
  <p>The companion program <code>Hexkit.Editor.exe</code> can be used to create or alter game scenarios. Visit the following sections for more information:</p>

  <h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
  <p>Hexkit Editor operates on scenario descriptions. A scenario is a list of definitions of game elements divided into a Master section and five subsections: Images, Variables, Entities, Factions, and Areas.</p>
  <p>The Master section file defines the scenario proper. Each of the subsections may be stored either as part of the Master section file (“inlined”), or as separate subsection files referenced by the Master section.</p>
  <p>External subsection files may be shared among multiple Master section files for easy scenario creation and maintenance. Subsections may be arbitrarily combined, as long as all game elements referred to by any section are properly defined within the same scenario.</p>
  <p>Hexkit Editor checks all user input for correctness, but accepts references to nonexistent scenario elements when reading section files. This allows the user to inspect and correct mismatched identifiers when mixing subsections from different scenarios. Note that all invalid references must be corrected before Hexkit Game will accept a scenario.</p>
  <p>The rules by which a scenario is played are a combination of built-in rules and an optional user-defined rule script. Hexkit Editor can attach a script file to a scenario but provides no facilities for editing or debugging such files. You will need an external text editor for this purpose, such as Notepad.</p>
  <p>The graphical tilesets required for the visual representation of a scenario may be supplied in any common bitmap file format. Hexkit Editor can attach bitmap files to a scenario but provides no facility for the creation or manipulation of such files. You will need an external paint program for this purpose, such as Windows Paint.</p>
  <p>Please refer to the <em>User’s Guide,</em> available as a separate download at the <a href="http://www.kynosarges.org/Hexkit.html" target="_blank">Hexkit home page</a>, for more information.</p>
  <h2><a name="Invocation">Invocation</a></h2>
  <p>You may supply the name of an XML file as a command line parameter to <code>Hexkit.Editor.exe</code>, and you may drag &amp; drop an XML file on the Hexit Editor program icon or on an instance of Hexkit Editor that is already running. Hexkit Editor will examine the XML file and automatically load it if it appears to be a scenario file. Saved game files (which Hexkit Editor cannot load) or unidentifiable files will generate an error message.</p>
  <p>When specifying a file name on the command line, you may omit the file extension and use “wildcard” characters (? and *). If you specify a file name without a directory path, Hexkit Editor will search for the file not only in the current directory, but also in the directory tree below the <code>Scenario</code> folder in your Hexkit installation directory.</p>
