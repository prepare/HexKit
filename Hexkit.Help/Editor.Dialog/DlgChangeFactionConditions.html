  <h1>Change Faction: Conditions Page</h1>

  <ul>

    <li><a href="#Victory">Victory Conditions</a></li>
    <li>See <a href="DlgChangeFaction.html">Change Faction</a> for a description of other controls in this dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Defeat">Defeat Conditions</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Check <b>Site Count</b> to indicate that the faction loses when it owns the specified number of sites or less.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Unit Count</b> to indicate that the faction loses when it owns the specified number of units or less.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Unit Strength</b> to indicate that the faction loses when the total strength of its units reaches the specified value or less.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Turn Count</b> to indicate that the faction loses when it has survived for the specified number of turns.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Victory">Victory Conditions</a></h2>
  <p>This box allows you to define the victory conditions for the specified faction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check <b>Site Count</b> to indicate that the faction wins when it owns the specified number of sites or more.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Unit Count</b> to indicate that the faction wins when it owns the specified number of units or more.</li>

  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>1. When a new faction is created, only the <b>Site Count</b> defeat condition is checked by default.</p>
  <p>2. The <b>Turn Count</b> conditions are intended to force the players to seek a decision by other means, before the specified turn limit runs out.</p>
  <p>3. Any resource-based conditions defined in the <a href="DlgChangeVariable.html">Change Variable</a> dialog apply to all factions using that resource, in addition to any individual conditions defined here.</p>
