  <h1>Change Information Dialog</h1>
  <p>This dialog allows you to edit various informational text for either the scenario or the graphical tileset, as specified in the dialogâ€™s title bar. This text will be shown to the player whenever a new game based on this scenario is started.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <b>Author (Alt+A)</b> field to enter or change the author name(s).</li>
    <li>Use the <b>Version (Alt+V)</b> field to enter or change the version number and/or creation date.</li>
    <li>Use the <b>Copyright (Alt+C)</b> field to enter or change legal information, such as trademarks or copyright statements.</li>
    <li>Use the large <b>Informational Text (Alt+I)</b> field to enter additional information about the scenario or graphical tileset. Text will wrap automatically to fit the display; you should only press <b>Enter</b> when you want to end a paragraph. You can also use blank lines (press <b>Enter</b> twice or more) to separate paragraphs.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>OK</b> or press <b>Enter</b> when the focus is not on the <b>Informational Text</b> field to accept any changes made and dismiss the dialog.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Cancel</b> or press <b>Escape</b> to discard any changes made and dismiss the dialog. Closing the window using <b>X (Close)</b> or <b>Alt+F4</b> has the same effect.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Help</b> or press <b>F1</b> to show this help page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>This dialog is available for the Master and Images sections only. We assume that the same author(s) will be responsible for all subsection data used in any one scenario, except for the image files. If this is not the case, credits for any additional author(s) should be included in the scenario information.</p>
  <p>The graphics information associated with the Images section is intended to store information about the graphical tileset and its creator(s). This information is stored separately because one graphical tileset, i.e. one set of image files, is likely to be used by many different scenario authors.</p>
