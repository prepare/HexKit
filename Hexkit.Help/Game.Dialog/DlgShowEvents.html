  <h1>Event History Dialog</h1>
  <p>This dialog shows the history of all factions and entities in the current game, including those that were already eliminated. The dialog is divided into two tab pages described separately.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="DlgShowEventsFactions.html">Factions Page</a></li>
    <li><a href="DlgShowEventsEntities.html">Entities Page</a></li>
    <li>Choose <b>OK</b> or press <b>Enter</b> to dismiss the dialog. Pressing <b>Escape</b> or closing the window using <b>X (Close)</b> or <b>Alt+F4</b> has the same effect.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Help</b> or press <b>F1</b> to show this help page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>The “events” tracked by this dialog are completely unrelated to the command events shown in the <a href="DlgShowCommands.html">Command History</a> dialog. They are essentially data points that Hexkit collects internally while a game is running, in order to facilitate debugging and statistical evaluation.</p>
