  <h1>Faction Status: Conditions Page</h1>
  <p>This tab page of the <a href="DlgShowFactions.html">Faction Status</a> dialog shows information on the selected faction’s victory and defeat conditions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>Condition List</b> shows all relevant game parameters and their values for the selected faction.
      <ul>
        <li>Column <b>Parameter</b> shows the following four entries, followed by any resources that the faction owns.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sites</b> indicates the number of sites owned by the faction.</li>
            <li><b>Units</b> indicates the number of units owned by the faction.</li>
            <li><b>Unit Strength</b> indicates the total strength of all units owned by the faction.</li>
            <li><b>Turns</b> indicates the number of turns that have been played so far.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Column <b>Defeat</b> shows the defeat threshold for each parameter. The faction will lose the game if the parameter’s current value falls to or below this threshold. A dash is shown for parameters without a defeat condition.</li>
        <li>Column <b>Current</b> shows the current value of each parameter. For resources, this is the faction’s current stockpile of each resource.</li>
        <li>Column <b>Victory</b> shows the victory threshold for each parameter. The faction will win the game if the parameter’s current value rises to or above this threshold. A dash is shown for parameters without a victory condition.</li>
        <li><b>Double-click</b> on a resource to show its <a href="DlgShowVariables.html">Variables</a> dialog. Double-clicking on other parameters has no effect.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>See <a href="DlgShowFactions.html">Faction Status</a> for a description of other controls in this dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>1. The <b>Condition List</b> is empty if the selected faction has already been eliminated from the game.</p>
  <p>2. Victory and defeat conditions that are based on a resource apply equally to all factions that own the resource. Other conditions may vary from one faction to another.</p>
