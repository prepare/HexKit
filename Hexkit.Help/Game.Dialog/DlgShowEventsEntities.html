  <h1>Event History: Entities Page</h1>
  <p>This tab page of the <a href="DlgShowEvents.html">Event History</a> dialog shows the history of all entities in the current game, including those that were already eliminated.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>Entity List</b> shows the internal identifiers of all entities.
      <ul>
        <li>All identifiers are composed of an entity class identifier (up to the final dash) and an instance count (after the final dash).</li>
        <li>The list entries are sorted alphabetically by entity class identifiers, and numerically by instance counts within the same entity class.</li>
        <li><b>Left-click</b> on an entry to select it. The <b>Event List</b> reflects the selected entry.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <b>Event List</b> shows the internal “events” that Hexkit recorded for the selected entity.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Turn</b> shows the game turn during which the event was recorded.</li>
        <li><b>Event</b> shows the type of the event.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create</b> means that the entity was created.</li>
            <li><b>Delete</b> means that the entity was deleted from the game.</li>
            <li><b>SetName</b> means that the entity’s instance name has changed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Value</b> shows other data associated with the event. This is usually the active faction at the time of the event, but it is the new instance name for the <b>SetName</b> event.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Drag</b> the vertical splitter between <b>Entity List</b> and <b>Event List</b> to adjust their respective share of the current dialog width.</li>
    <li>See <a href="DlgShowEvents.html">Event History</a> for a description of other controls in this dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>All entities that were created by the scenario, and possibly by the <code>Faction.Initialize</code> method if it was overriden in the rule script, will appear with a <b>Create</b> event during the first turn and with the first active faction.</p>
