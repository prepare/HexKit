  <h1>Player Setup: Selected Computer Player</h1>
  <p>This box appears on the <a href="DlgChangePlayers.html">Player Setup</a> dialog when the selected faction is controlled by a computer player.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <b>Algorithm (Alt+A)</b> to select the algorithm employed by the computer player. The remaining controls vary to reflect the optional settings available for the selected algorithm.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Random Building (Alt+B)</b> to force the computer player to build entities randomly, rather than assessing the desirability of each entity.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Random Placement (Alt+P)</b> to force the computer player to place entities randomly on the map, rather than assessing the desirability of each placement site.</li>
    <li>Check <b>Scripted Behavior (Alt+S)</b> to enable all scripted behavior imposed by the rule script on computer-controlled factions. Unchecking this option disables all or some of this behavior, depending on the scenario.</li>
    <li>Use <b>Target Limit (Alt+T)</b> to enter the maximum number of potential targets that the computer player should examine for each unit. Higher values may provide better target selection at the expense of slower turn calculations.</li>
    <li>See <a href="DlgChangePlayers.html">Player Setup</a> for a description of other controls in this dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <p>The current Hexkit version offers only the simple “Seeker” algorithm. Please refer to the <em>User’s Guide</em> for details.</p>
