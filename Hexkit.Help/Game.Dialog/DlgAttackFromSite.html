  <h1>Attack From Site Dialog</h1>
  <p>This dialog shows all units that can attack from the source site specified in the dialogâ€™s title bar, and allows you to select the target site and the units to perform the attack.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#Map">Map View</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Losses">Projected Losses</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Units">Unit List</a></li>
    <li><b>Drag</b> the vertical splitter between <a href="#Map">Map View</a> and <a href="#Units">Unit List</a> to adjust their respective share of the current window width.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>OK</b> or press <b>Enter</b> to accept the selected units and target site, dismiss the dialog, and execute the attack.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Cancel</b> or press <b>Escape</b> to dismiss the dialog without attacking. Closing the window using <b>X (Close)</b> or <b>Alt+F4</b> has the same effect.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Help</b> or press <b>F1</b> to show this help page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Map">Map View</a></h2>
  <p>The left side of this dialog is taken up by a map view. The source site of the attack is initially centered and selected.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Highlighted</b> sites are valid attack targets. The highlights always reflect the attack range of all units currently selected in the <a href="#Units">Unit List</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Left-click</b> to select a highlighted site as the target site of the attack.</li>
    <li><b>Double-click</b> to select a highlighted site as the target site and immediately close the dialog, as with the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a highlighted site is selected, the map view shows a red arrow from the attackers towards the target site to visualize the direction of the attack.</p>
  <h2><a name="Losses">Projected Losses</a></h2>
  <p>This message shows the estimated losses for the attacker and the defender if the currently selected units performed an attack on the currently selected target site. Both numbers are given as percentages of the current combined strength of all attacking and defending units, respectively.</p>
  <p>These numbers are not usually precise, and their exact meaning depends on the current scenario. In general, however, 100% means outright destruction of all units, while 0% means that no unit will suffer any damage whatsoever.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Projected losses appear only if the selected site is a valid target site for an attack.</p>
  <h2><a name="Units">Unit List</a></h2>
  <p>This list shows all units in the source site that are eligible for attack, and allows you to select which units should attack.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Left-click</b> on an entry to select it.</li>
    <li><b>Double-click</b> on an entry to show its <a href="DlgShowClasses.html">Entity Classes</a> dialog.</li>
    <li><b>Check</b> an entry to have the unit participate in the attack.</li>
    <li><b>Uncheck</b> an entry to exclude the unit from the attack.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Check All (Alt+C)</b> to check all units.</li>
    <li>Choose <b>Uncheck All (Alt+U)</b> to uncheck all units.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <b>Property List</b> shows the statistics of the selected unit. Please refer to the <a href="GameViewProperty.html">Property List</a> page for details.</p>
